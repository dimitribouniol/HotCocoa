Intro
=====

HotCocoa is (or will become) a super awesome, well designed, IDE, made just for iOS devices. Planned features include:

- Full code-editing support, including syntax highlighting and autocomplete
- Documentation access
- Xcode project management
- Git support
- Remote building and Ad-Hoc testing

Although ambitious, I think making this available will finally mature the iOS platform into one that can sustain itself (ie. be able to write programs for itself), and that in itself can become something really amazing!
